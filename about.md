Hey there! I’m Declan. I like to play music, make things, code, learn stuff, and do some photography.

I did my PhD in Physics at Brown University. Since then, I've been working on many coding projects. This site is a showcase of some of them.

[My other website](https://www.declanoller.com) also has less technical stuff, like a wider array of projects and photography. Note that, because I write the posts there on Wordpress and then migrate them to this site, a few formatting things are a bit off (like image galleries getting turned into lists of images) and some of the links on this site are to posts there, but the content is identical.

Please poke around, and if you’d like to contact me about anything, please email me at (my first name)(my last name)^at^gmail^dot^com.
