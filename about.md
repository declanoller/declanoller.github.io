Hey there! My name's Declan. I like to learn stuff, make things, play music, code, and take some pictures.

I did my PhD in Physics at Brown University. Since 2020, I've been working at Sony AI, where I'm a research scientist applying reinforcement learning to video games. In my spare time, I do lots of odd projects, and this site is where I share some of them.

Please poke around, and if youâ€™d like to contact me about anything, please email me at (my first name)(my last name)^at^gmail^dot^com.
